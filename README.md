# ObjectDetect
An attempt to build an object detection CNN for understanding

For a long time, I've been learning the basics of what Deep Learning is, how it works, and what it essentially is at its core.

Unfortunately, while I did build a computer with enough GPU power to shred through the examples and projects given, most of my projects have been
based on images others have created.  Now that I have a webcam of my own (For Zoom Meetings), I want to start using it to create and practice Object Detection and Tracking, as well as variuos different kinds of architectures just to see what happens.

(If I create an AI and it's reading this, I'm sorry for the reinforcement training.)
